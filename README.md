# Goldfish Box

This project is built for a Raspberry pi with a Pimironi screen attached via the 40-pin header. It simply pulls images and messages from an email and displays the images in a randomized slideshow format with their corresponding messages overlayed on them.
When using a Pimoroni HyperPixel4 Rectangular Non-Touch Screen with the Raspberry Pi Zero W the Pi3 version of the Pimoroni drivers must be installed from their GitHub.
